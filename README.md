 # Data-Analyst-Portfolio
## About
I am Wipas, I graduated with a Second-Class Honours degree in Business Administration. During my first job, I had the opportunity to manage multiple projects simultaneously. Data management and research were instrumental in my success, fueling my interest and desire to develop my skills in this area beyond project management, I pursued online courses from Google Advance Data Analytics and Datarockie Data Science Bootcamp. These courses have equipped me with a strong foundation in data analysis and a keen interest in using data to extract valuable insights. I am enthusiastic about applying my technical and analytical abilities to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.  

Independent learning further strengthened my ability to handle complex data sets. This period also fostered a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. Additionally, I expanded my knowledge in machine learning, data management, and statistical analysis, all of which will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.  

My commitment to continuous learning is evident in my dedication to exploring new data analysis tools and techniques during my free time. I am constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skillset. Whether working collaboratively or independently, I am motivated by the challenge of uncovering new insights and the gratification of leveraging data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## SQL 
### Project: Death Rate Per Age Group in Thailand 2021 Data Exploration 
**Link**: Death Rate Per Age Group in Thailand 2021

**Goal**: To explore data using EDA method.

**Description**: This Project  blank blank blank

**Skill**: Basic SQL statements, subqueries

**Tool**: BigQuery Sandbox

### Project: Student Performance Data Exploration
**Link**: Student performance project  

**Goal**: To explore data using EDA method.  

**Description**: This project entails data acquisition, cleansing, and exploration (Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA) to uncover patterns. SQL statements and subqueries will be employed to facilitate this in-depth analysis.  

**Skill**: Basic SQL statements, subqueries

**Tool**: SQLite  

## R programming language  
### Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study
**Link**: Cyclistic bike-share

**Goal**: To design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

**Description**: Pretending I'm a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compeling data insights and professional data visualizations.

**Skill**: Ask right question, Prepare data, Clean data, Analyze data, Visualize data, and Suggesting a recommendation

**Tool**: R programming language: library(ggplot2) for visualization

**Result**: Our data visualization reveals distinct usage patterns between casual riders and members. Membership data suggests a strong correlation with commuting, evidenced by peak usage during morning and evening rush hours. Conversely, casual ridership exhibits a seasonal trend, concentrated during the summer months (June-August). Based on this analysis, a targeted marketing campaign aimed at non-member office workers and summer casual riders is recommended. This campaign could leverage free trials and discount offers to incentivize membership subscriptions.

### Creating Chatbot to Order Pizza
**Link**: Chatbot order pizza  

**Goal**: To create chatbot for user to order pizza  

**Description**: Utilized R to create chatbot which it'll ask user name, show the menu, ask what user would like to order, and calculate the price. Function readline() was implemented to ask for user input.  

**Skill**: R programming language: flush.console(), readline(), control flow

**Tool**: Rstudio

## Python
### Project: Average Learning Outcome Vs GDP Per Capita Analysis  
**Link**: Average Learning Outcome Vs GDP Per Capita  
**Goal**: To explore data using EDA method.  
**Description**: Data preprocessing involving data cleaning, outlier detection and removal, data relationship analysis, and data visualization in multiple dimensions. 
**Skill**: Prepare data, Clean data, Analyze data, Visualize data  
**Tool**: Python: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib   


### Share of Global Merchandise Exports
**Link**: Share of Global Merchandise Exports  
**Goal**: To conduct a historical and current analysis of regional export trends.  
**Description**: Data preparation involving data cleaning through null value imputation, data analysis, and data visualization to analyze regional export trends from 2000 to 2020.
**Skill**: Prepare data, Clean data, Analyze data, Visualize data  
**Tool**: Python: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib  


### Project: Discover Correlation Between Inflation Rate and Goverment Debt to Quality of Life  
**Link**: Correlation of inflation and debt to quality of life  
**Goal**: To discover whether inflation rate and government in Thailand from 2005 - 2020 has any impact on quality of life.  

**Desciption**: Performed exploratory data analysis to spot any inconsistences and missing values of the dataset and then cleaned it. One of the dataframes that has been used in this analysis is in incorrect format, so I decided to build new dataframe based on the data in the original dataframe but make it in correct format. After cleaned and filtered data that'll be using in this analysis, I created data visualization to help identify patterns and uncover relationships between each dataframes.  

**Skill**: Prepare data, Clean data, Analyze data, Visualize data  

**Tool**: Python: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib  

**Result**: The visualizations show the correlation between government debt and quality of life and show that there's negative correlation between inflation rate and government debt.
